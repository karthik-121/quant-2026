Portfolio of quant topics from scratch

Folder Structure:
/data -- data needed for future projects, etc
/notebooks -- specific jupyter notebooks of practice for each day
/src -- math modules/python practice for each day

Week 1 progress:
- added numerical approximation formulas for first, second, third derivative
- plotted for matplotlib familiarity
- discovered limitations of finite difference formulas due to truncation/rounding errors
